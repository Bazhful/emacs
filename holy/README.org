* TPHmacs: holy

This is the bare minimum for a holy config.

** What is holy?
It's a stolen distinction from /evil/. We're more GNU orientated
than vim.

* Installation
If you already have a ~.emacs.d~ either remove it or move it (eg
~mv ~/.emac.d ~/.emacs.d.old~). Next, clone this repository using
~git clone git@github.com:the-programmers-hangout/emacs.git~. And then
use the command ~cp -r emacs/holy ~/.emacs.d~.

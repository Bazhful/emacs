* Additional C / C++ components

If you want to use [[https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls][ccls]], which supports more language server features than clangd like overlays and semantic highlighting,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ccls
  :after lsp-mode
  :hook ((c-mode c++-mode) . (lambda ()
                               (require 'ccls)
                               (lsp))))
#+END_SRC

If you have trouble with installing ccls from your package manager, you might need to compile it from source and point =ccls-executable= to it.

* Additional Rust components

For code completion, there is also the possibility to use racer through https://github.com/racer-rust/emacs-racer, however it requires nightly Rust; rls and rust-analyzer work on the stable channel. It also requires some functionality that is in =rust-mode= but not =rustic=. Here is a translation of the instructions from their README:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package rust-mode
  :init
  (use-package racer
    :hook ((rust-mode . racer-mode)
           (racer-mode . eldoc-mode)
           (racer-mode . company-mode))
    :bind (:map rust-mode-map
                ("TAB" . company-indent-or-complete))))
#+END_SRC

* Evil

** What is evil?

   *Evil* is an *e* xtensible *v* i *l* ayer for Emacs.

** Prerequisites

   The extensible vi layer emulates the main features of Vim and adds
   them onto Emacs. This is something which is essential for any former
   Vim user and works right out of the box without any specific
   configuration additions, however evil depends on [[file:undo-tree.org][undo-tree]].

** Evil Configuration

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package evil
  :after undo-tree
  :ensure t
  :config
  (evil-mode 1))

                                        ; evil escape
(use-package evil-escape)
(evil-escape-mode t)

(setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence "fd")
(setq-default evil-escape-delay 0.2)
   #+end_src
